# BlueCaster (formerly A2DP-Windows-Bridge)

Advanced Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for Windows. It adds the codecs Windows lacks, such as LDAC, LHDC V5, aptX Adaptive and aptX HD, by running its own Bluetooth stack on a USB Bluetooth adapter through WinUSB. No kernel driver or test signing is needed.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 (22H2) or 11**, x64 or ARM64 (ARM64 and Windows 10 not yet tried on real hardware)
- **A USB Bluetooth adapter for BlueCaster**. A separate dongle is recommended: a built-in adapter works too if it is a USB device (as in many laptops), but Windows then has no Bluetooth of its own while BlueCaster uses it. See [Recommended Adapters](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/setup#adapters) and the [verified hardware](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/hardware).

### Why does BlueCaster take over a whole adapter?

Windows loads only kernel drivers signed through Microsoft, which requires an EV code signing certificate (several hundred US dollars a year, usually only for companies). BlueCaster instead puts the adapter on Microsoft's own signed WinUSB driver and runs the Bluetooth stack in user mode. If you want something simpler, commercial software with a signed driver works with the built-in Bluetooth.

## Setup

1. **Install**: run `BlueCaster-<version>-win64-setup.exe` (`-arm64-setup.exe` on ARM64; no administrator rights needed), or extract the portable zip and run `bluecaster.exe`. Installing over v1 or A2DP Windows Bridge 2.0.x replaces it and keeps its settings, pairings and firmware.
2. **Plug in the adapter.**
3. **Follow the first-run setup**: choose the adapter and press **Set up this adapter**. It assigns WinUSB (Windows asks for administrator permission) and downloads the firmware Realtek adapters need. Then press **Connect** next to your headphones.
4. After that, connect from **Home** or the tray icon.

> **Warning:** While WinUSB is assigned, Windows' own Bluetooth cannot use the adapter. With the built-in adapter, the PC has no Windows Bluetooth at all until you restore the driver. **Adapters > Restore original driver** gives the adapter back to Windows at any time, and the uninstaller offers it too.

See the [Setup guide](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/setup) and the [Usage guide](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/usage). For dropouts or failed connections: [Dropouts and Connection Problems](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/wireless).

## Features

- **Codec choice**: picks the best codec the headphones support, or the one you choose; ABR on LHDC V5, LDAC and aptX Adaptive
- **LE Audio (experimental)**: LC3 to LE Audio headphones and earbuds with a Bluetooth 5.2 adapter; tested only against the Bluetooth emulator ([details](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/usage#le-audio))
- **Capture**: all system audio, a virtual audio device (e.g. VB-CABLE), or one application
- **Runs in the tray**: keeps streaming with the window closed, reconnects after a lost link and after sleep
- **Driver setup in the app**: assigns and restores WinUSB without Zadig; headphones paired in Windows through the adapter connect without pairing again
- **Headphone controls**: volume sync and play / pause / next / previous
- **Diagnostics**: link quality, AFH (avoids your Wi-Fi channels), connection flow, log, HCI capture
- **Command line**: `bluecaster-core.exe --cli` ([CLI Mode](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/usage#cli-mode))
- **Updates**: daily check, updates itself
- **8 languages**: English, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified / Traditional), Korean, German, French, Spanish
- **Headset microphone (experimental, developer mode)**: the headphones' microphone as a Windows microphone through a virtual audio cable such as VB-CABLE; classic devices play at call quality meanwhile, LE Audio keeps its quality ([details](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/usage#codecs))
- **Works with** third-party apps such as earbud control apps: [Works With](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/works-with) (not supported by this project)

## Building

Requirements: **Rust** 1.90+, **Visual Studio 2022+** with the C++ desktop workload, **Node.js 22** with **pnpm** (`corepack enable`), **Git**, **PowerShell 7**.

```powershell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SeiyaFunaokaJP/BlueCaster.git
cd BlueCaster
pwsh ./build.ps1                      # bluecaster.exe, bluecaster-core.exe, bluecaster-driver.exe in target/release/
pwsh ./build.ps1 -Release -Arch x64   # installer and portable zip (-Arch arm64 for ARM64)
```

Double-clicking `build.bat` runs the first command. The other switches (debug build, tests, emulator test) are listed at the top of [build.ps1](build.ps1). See [Building](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/building) for the steps one by one and [Architecture](https://seiyafunaokajp.github.io/BlueCaster/architecture) for how the programs fit together.
