//! HFP audio (headset microphone, developer mode): the audio connection on
//! the HFP service level connection, and SCO data both ways.
//!
//! [`crate::BtHost::voice_start`] hands a [`VoiceTx`] and a [`VoiceRx`] to
//! the BTstack thread and asks the HFP audio gateway for the audio
//! connection (codec negotiation first). Once it is up, received SCO
//! payloads go to the `VoiceRx`, and on every HCI_EVENT_SCO_CAN_SEND_NOW the
//! `VoiceTx` fills one packet of the length BTstack wants for the
//! connection. The codec is the caller's business: payloads are what goes
//! over HCI (CVSD: 16-bit linear PCM, mSBC / LC3-SWB: H2 framed frames).
//!
//! SCO must be able to flow before BTstack is asked for a packet length: on
//! an H2 transport BTstack asserts (and aborts the process) unless the
//! controller's SCO data packet length holds 3 ms of audio, and the USB
//! transport's isochronous pipes may not run. A link that cannot carry SCO
//! is given up ([`VoiceEvent::Failed`] with [`NO_SCO_PATH`]), and so is one
//! whose sends keep failing.
